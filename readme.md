# :zap: Flexable grid for React.js :zap:

## :zap: Merge selected cells and Drag&Drop to anywhere inside grid :zap:

### :zap: Motivation :zap:

Using visuals can be effective when it comes to memoizing. <br>
As a [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) user, I wanted to leverage memoizing with using more visuals. <br>
Therefore, I created [Memory Islands](https://www.memoryislands.com.tr/)

### :zap: Usage :zap:

### :zap: Features :zap:

You can bring your custom component for merged cells.<br>

### :zap: Using Examples :zap:
